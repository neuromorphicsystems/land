# Neuromorphic Datasets Repository

This repository contains the entries for each tracked neuromorphic dataset. The entries are stored in a mixture of `json` for metadata and `markdown` for additional content.

The `json` metadata is validated using a schema, the definitions of which can be found in the /schemas/ directory.

The datasets themselves are stored in the /datasets/ directory, with a separate file for each dataset.
