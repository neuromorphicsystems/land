        "abstract": "Bio-inspired spike camera mimics the sampling principle of primate fovea. It presents high temporal resolution and dynamic range, showing great promise in fast-moving object recognition. However, the physical limit of CMOS technology in spike cameras still hinders their capability of recognizing ultra-high-speed moving objects, e.g., extremely fast motions cause blur during the imaging process of spike cameras. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for the causes of spiking motion blur and proposes a robust representation that addresses this issue through temporal-spatial context learning. The proposed method leverages multi-span feature aggregation to capture temporal cues and employs residual deformable convolution to model spatial correlation among neighbouring pixels. Additionally, this paper contributes an original real-captured spiking recognition dataset consisting of 12,000 ultra-high-speed (equivalent speed &gt; 500 km/h) moving objects. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 73.2% accuracy in recognizing 10 classes of ultra-high-speed moving objects, outperforming all existing spike-based recognition methods.
