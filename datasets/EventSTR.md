In this paper, we propose to recognize the scene text using bio-inspired event cameras by collecting and annotating a large-scale benchmark dataset, termed EventSTR. It contains 9,928 high-definition (1280 * 720) event samples and involves both Chinese and English characters. We also benchmark multiple STR algorithms as the baselines for future works to compare. In addition, we propose a new event-based scene text recognition framework, termed SimC-ESTR. It first extracts the event features using a visual encoder and projects them into tokens using a Q-former module. More importantly, we propose to augment the vision tokens based on a memory mechanism before feeding into the large language models. A similarity-based error correction mechanism is embedded within the large language model to correct potential minor errors fundamentally based on contextual information. Extensive experiments on the newly proposed EventSTR dataset and two simulation STR datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We believe that the dataset and algorithmic model can innovatively propose an event-based STR task and are expected to accelerate the application of event cameras in various industries.
