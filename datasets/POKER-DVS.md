        "abstract": "This article reports on two databases for event-driven object recognition using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The first, which we call Poker-DVS and is being released together with this article, was obtained by browsing specially made poker card decks in front of a DVS camera for 2\u20134 s. Each card appeared on the screen for about 20\u201330 ms. The poker pips were tracked and isolated off-line to constitute the 131-recording Poker-DVS database. The second database, which we call MNIST-DVS and which was released in December 2013, consists of a set of 30,000 DVS camera recordings obtained by displaying 10,000 moving symbols from the standard MNIST 70,000-picture database on an LCD monitor for about 2\u20133 s each. Each of the 10,000 symbols was displayed at three different scales, so that event-driven object recognition algorithms could easily be tested for different object sizes. This article tells the story behind both databases, covering, among other aspects, details of how they work and the reasons for their creation. We provide not only the databases with corresponding scripts, but also the scripts and data used to generate the figures shown in this article (as Supplementary Material).",

### Dataset Structure

The POKER-DVS database consists of a set of 131 poker pip symbols tracked and extracted from 3 separate DVS recordings, while browsing very quickly poker cards.

Original DVS recorded files are 128x128 pixel and can be displayed with jAER (available from: [http://sourceforge.net/p/jaer/wiki/Home](http://sourceforge.net/p/jaer/wiki/Home)). MatlabTMscripts are provided to track and extract individual poker pip symbols as they cross the screen and extract them as 32x32 pixel event streams, each of which can also be visualized with jAER. The extracted symbols are readily available (no need to run the MatlabTM scripts).

A more detailed description of the recording procedure and the database can be found in
