        "abstract": "Smart urban mobility is an important approach for meeting the rapid increasing demanding of the urban populations. Urban mobility problems could be more effectively resolved by artificial intelligent techniques. Traditional visual sensors and visual algorithms suffer from low dynamic response and high computational cost. This paper proposes an Event-camera Traffic-flow Measuring Graph Neural Network (ETM-GNN) method for traffic flow detection, which features low sampling latency and sparse data sampling characteristics. An optimized proximity search strategy is firstly developed for event-data preprocessing to construct an event graph, which is then fed into the proposed graph-based neural network for traffic detection. An innovational graph convolution block is developed by applying layer normalization instead of batch normalization for sequential event-data. The overall detection accuracy of the proposed approach reached as high as 85.62%, with equivalent event frame rate of 40 frames per second on average. The proposed method can be further applied to other areas where high dynamical object detection is required.",
